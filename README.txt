This code implements a simple interactive game in Python where the user can practice naming U.S. states on a map using Turtle graphics.

The necessary libraries include: 
1. Turtle for graphics and 
2. Pandas for data manipulation.

The game allows the user to input US state names until they either guess all (50) states or choose to exit.

For each guess, it checks if the input state is valid (i.e., among the 50 U.S. states).
If the guess is correct, it increments the attempt counter, adds the state to the list of guessed states, and displays the state name on the map using Turtle graphics.
If the user types "Exit", the game ends, and a list of states that were not guessed is saved to a CSV file named "states_to_learn.csv".
